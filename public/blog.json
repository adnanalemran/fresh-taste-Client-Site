    "description": "JanuaryOne-way data binding is a concept in web development where data flows from a model (data source) to a view (user interface). Changes in the model are reflected in the view, ensuring a unidirectional data flow. This approach is commonly used in frameworks like AngularJS, React, and Vue.js."

    "description": "MongoDB is a NoSQL database with a flexible, document-oriented data model, while MySQL is a relational database with a fixed schema. MongoDB is well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data and scalability, but it may not offer full ACID compliance. MySQL is better for applications with well-defined schemas, complex queries, and strong transactional requirements. The choice depends on your project's specific needs and your familiarity with each database."
